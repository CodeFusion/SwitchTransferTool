            <li>
                Improved Design - The official Switch app got a facelift, so STT did too!

            <li>
                Light Mode - Most developers may use dark mode, but I know there are some of you who prefer the light.
                Your device's theme will be used by default, but you can choose a theme in Settings.
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
                Faster Connection - QR Scanning is now default. Press the WiFi icon on the scanning screen to switch
                to manual mode or change the default in settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                Android 13 Support - The app now uses the new more specific file permissions and has a Material You compatible icon.

                Source Code - Code is finally available! View, fork, or make a PR <a href="https://github.com/CodeFusion/SwitchTransferTool">on Github.</a>
